# GH Social Backend v2

This service is the system of record for users, repositories, social state, feed serves, and interaction history. New clients must use only the APIs documented here. The legacy `/api/users`, `/api/repos`, `/api/activity`, `/api/comment`, `/api/boards`, `/api/containers`, `/api/onboarding`, and `/api/feed` routes are disabled unless `LEGACY_API_ENABLED=true`.

## Authority boundaries

| Component | May read/write | Must not do |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Public backend HTTP API | Query Supabase tables, Redis, ML, or Qdrant directly |
| Backend | PostgreSQL `app` and `telemetry`; Redis feed queues; authenticated ML HTTP API | Store product state only in Redis or accept client-supplied user ownership |
| ML | Backend-delivered jobs; Qdrant vectors; its own model artifacts | Query product tables, create canonical user/repository IDs, or serve frontend traffic |
| Qdrant | Vectors and searchable ML payloads written by ML | Act as the repository catalog or decide record identity |
| Ingestion job | GitHub/source data; internal ingestion API | Write PostgreSQL or Qdrant directly |

Supabase Auth owns credentials and provider identities. `app.users.user_id` equals `auth.users.id`; the backend owns the product profile. PostgreSQL owns durable state. Redis is an expendable feed queue. Qdrant is an expendable projection that can always be rebuilt from backend repository mappings.

## Canonical identity

- `user_id`: UUID created by Supabase Auth and registered transactionally in `app.users`.
- `repo_id`: UUID created only by `POST /api/internal/v2/ingestion/repositories/upsert`.
- `github_id`: immutable numeric GitHub repository ID, represented as a decimal string over HTTP.
- ML and Qdrant must use `repo_id` as the canonical key. Qdrant points may use another point ID only if payload field `repo_id` is present and uniquely identifies the backend repository.
- Names, URLs, GitHub handles, and `full_name` are attributes, never identifiers.

## Response and authentication conventions

Public API successes use:

```json
{ "success": true, "data": {} }
```

Public API errors use:

```json
{ "success": false, "error": "Human-readable message." }
```

Feed, interaction, ingestion, and operations v2 endpoints return their versioned contract directly. Authentication uses `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`. The access token lasts 15 minutes. Refresh tokens are rotated in a secure HTTP-only cookie scoped to `/api/auth`. Internal routes require `x-internal-secret`; during rotation they accept `INTERNAL_API_SECRET_PREVIOUS` as well.

All timestamps are ISO 8601 UTC. All IDs described as UUIDs must be valid UUID strings. Request bodies are limited to 256 KB. List endpoints accept `limit=1..100` and `offset=0..10000` unless stated otherwise.

## Frontend API

### Authentication

| Method and path | Body | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/auth/signup` | `{email,password,username,full_name?}` | Creates Supabase identity plus backend profile, returns `{accessToken,token,user}` |
| `POST /api/auth/login` | `{email,password}` | Returns access token and rotates refresh cookie |
| `POST /api/auth/refresh` | none; refresh cookie required | Consumes old refresh token and returns a new access token/cookie |
| `POST /api/auth/logout` | none | Revokes refresh token and clears cookie |
| `GET /api/auth/github` | none | Returns the provider authorization URL |
| `GET /api/auth/google` | none | Returns the provider authorization URL |
| `GET /api/auth/callback` | provider redirect | Creates a five-minute one-time exchange code and redirects frontend |
| `POST /api/auth/exchange` | `{code}` | Consumes OAuth code and returns access token/cookie |

Signup/profile creation and ML onboarding enqueue are one backend transaction. OAuth callback ensures the product profile exists before issuing a code. ML downtime never blocks authentication because onboarding delivery uses the outbox.

### User and onboarding

| Method and path | Body/query | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v2/users/me` | none | Private profile, stats, topic slugs, feed and feedback versions |
| `PATCH /api/v2/users/me` | Any subset of `{username,full_name,bio,github_handle,avatar_url}` | Updated profile; unknown fields are rejected |
| `GET /api/v2/users/:userId` | none | Public active profile and stats |
| `PUT /api/v2/users/:userId/follow` | none | Idempotently follows; `204` |
| `DELETE /api/v2/users/:userId/follow` | none | Idempotently unfollows; `204` |
| `GET /api/v2/users/:userId/followers` | `limit`, `offset` | Followers |
| `GET /api/v2/users/:userId/following` | `limit`, `offset` | Following users |
| `GET /api/v2/users/:userId/likes-given` | `limit`, `offset` | Repositories liked by the user |
| `GET /api/v2/onboarding/status` | none | `{completed,profile_version}` |
| `PUT /api/v2/onboarding` | `{bio?,topics:[slug,...]}` | Replaces interests, increments profile version, enqueues ML onboarding |

Topic slugs are lowercase letters/numbers/hyphens, 1-50 characters. Onboarding accepts 1-50 unique topics.

### Repositories

| Method and path | Body/query | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v2/repositories` | `q?`, `limit`, `offset` | Active repository cards with latest stats and active ML summary |
| `GET /api/v2/repositories/:repoId` | none | Repository detail including README and topics |
| `GET /api/v2/repositories/trending` | `period` default `daily` | Active complete trending snapshot, ordered by position |
| `GET /api/v2/repositories/saved` | `limit`, `offset` | Current user's saved repositories |

The frontend cannot import or mutate repository metadata. It records likes, saves, views, and other behavior through the interaction endpoint below. Repository details come from PostgreSQL, not ML/Qdrant.

### Feed

`POST /api/v2/feed`

```json
{
  "feed_request_id": "client-generated UUID",
  "session_id": "stable UUID for this app session",
  "limit": 10,
  "cursor": null
}
```

The response contains `serve_id`, `feed_version`, `source`, `model_version`, `items`, and `next_cursor`. Reusing the same `feed_request_id` is an idempotent replay and returns the same persisted serve. Pass a non-null `next_cursor` with a new `feed_request_id` to consume the next queue page. Cursors are opaque, signed, and bound to the user, session, feed version, and next position; invalid or stale cursors return `400`. `limit` is 1-25. If ML or Redis is unavailable, the backend serves a durable PostgreSQL fallback when possible.

### Interactions

`POST /api/v2/interactions/batch` accepts 1-50 events:

```json
{
  "events": [{
    "event_id": "client-generated UUID",
    "schema_version": 2,
    "session_id": "UUID",
    "serve_id": "UUID or null",
    "repo_id": "backend UUID",
    "position": 0,
    "event_type": "like",
    "dwell_ms": null,
    "client_occurred_at": "2026-07-15T12:00:00.000Z",
    "context": {}
  }]
}
```

Allowed events: `impression`, `dwell`, `readme_open`, `github_open`, `like`, `unlike`, `dislike`, `undislike`, `save`, `unsave`, and `share`. `dwell` requires 3000-300000 ms; other events require `dwell_ms:null`. `event_id` provides durable idempotency. The backend applies reaction/save state, updates counters and versions, and inserts ML feedback into the same transaction. It returns `202` with accepted/duplicate counts.

### Comments

| Method and path | Body/query | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v2/repositories/:repoId/comments` | `limit`, `offset` | Chronological comments with author projection |
| `POST /api/v2/repositories/:repoId/comments` | `{body,parent_comment_id?}` | Creates comment; parent must belong to same repo |
| `PATCH /api/v2/comments/:commentId` | `{body}` | Updates only the current user's comment |
| `DELETE /api/v2/comments/:commentId` | none | Deletes only the current user's comment; `204` |

Comment bodies are 1-5000 trimmed characters.

### Collections and boards

| Method and path | Body | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/v2/collections` | none | Current user's collections and board counts |
| `POST /api/v2/collections` | `{name,description?}` | Creates collection |
| `PUT /api/v2/collections/:collectionId` | `{name,description?}` | Replaces mutable fields |
| `DELETE /api/v2/collections/:collectionId` | none | Deletes collection; boards become ungrouped |
| `GET /api/v2/boards` | none | Current user's boards and repo counts |
| `POST /api/v2/boards` | `{name,description?,visibility,collection_id?}` | Creates board |
| `PUT /api/v2/boards/:boardId` | same fields | Replaces mutable fields |
| `DELETE /api/v2/boards/:boardId` | none | Deletes board |
| `GET /api/v2/boards/:boardId/repositories` | none | Owner or public/unlisted board contents |
| `PUT /api/v2/boards/:boardId/repositories/:repoId` | none | Idempotently adds repository; owner only |
| `DELETE /api/v2/boards/:boardId/repositories/:repoId` | none | Removes repository; owner only |

Visibility is `private`, `public`, or `unlisted`. User ownership always comes from JWT, never request JSON.

## Ingestion API

Only a trusted ingestion process calls these endpoints.

### Repository upsert

`POST /api/internal/v2/ingestion/repositories/upsert`, maximum 100 records:

```json
{
  "repositories": [{
    "github_id": "123456789",
    "github_node_id": "R_kg...",
    "full_name": "owner/repository",
    "owner": "owner",
    "name": "repository",
    "url": "https://github.com/owner/repository",
    "description": "...",
    "readme": "...",
    "primary_language": "TypeScript",
    "languages": ["TypeScript"],
    "topics": ["expo"],
    "star_count": 100,
    "fork_count": 5,
    "open_issues_count": 2,
    "pushed_at": "2026-07-15T12:00:00Z",
    "observed_at": "2026-07-15T12:05:00Z"
  }]
}
```

The response is `{mappings:[{github_id,repo_id,content_version,changed}]}`. The ingestion process must retain this mapping for the run. When content changes, the backend inserts a `repo_index` outbox job. Do not send data to Qdrant before receiving `repo_id`.

### Trending snapshot

`POST /api/internal/v2/ingestion/trending/snapshots` accepts `{snapshot_id,period,computed_at,source,repositories}` where repository entries use the upsert shape plus unique non-negative `rank` and optional `score`. Activation is atomic: incomplete snapshots never become frontend-visible.

## Backend-to-ML API

The backend is the client and ML implements these internal endpoints. Every request includes `x-internal-secret`, `x-request-id`, `idempotency-key`, and `schema_version:2`.

| ML endpoint | Purpose | Required response behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/v2/recommendations/generate` | Generate canonical `repo_id` ranking | Echo `generation_id`, `user_id`, `feed_version`; return unique known repo UUIDs, scores, model and embedding versions |
| `POST /api/v2/feedback/batch` | Apply durable interaction feedback | Idempotent by event IDs/idempotency key |
| `POST /api/v2/users/onboard` | Create/update user vector/profile | Idempotent by `job_id` and monotonic `profile_version` |
| `POST /api/v2/repositories/embed` | Create vector from canonical repo content | Idempotent by `job_id`; payload includes `repo_id` and `content_version` |
| `POST /api/v2/repositories/refresh` | Refresh derived features | Idempotent by `job_id` and feature version |
| `GET /api/v2/health` | ML/Qdrant readiness | Non-2xx when ML cannot safely accept work |

ML must return 2xx only after durable acceptance. Use `429` or `503` for retryable pressure/failure and an optional `Retry-After`; use other 4xx responses for terminal contract errors. The backend outbox retries with capped jitter, leases jobs with `SKIP LOCKED`, and moves terminal/expired work to `dead` for operator replay.

Recommendation response shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "generation_id": "UUID",
  "user_id": "UUID",
  "feed_version": 12,
  "model_version": "model-2026-07",
  "embedding_version": "embed-v3",
  "items": [{"repo_id":"UUID","score":0.91,"source":"personalized"}]
}
```

## Qdrant contract and rebuild

Qdrant is not an HTTP consumer of this backend. ML owns Qdrant reads/writes and receives all authoritative changes through backend jobs.

Recommended repository payload fields are `repo_id`, `github_id`, `content_version`, `content_hash`, `embedding_version`, `model_version`, and `indexed_at`. Create a fresh versioned collection for a dimensionality or distance change. Ingest backend mappings, embed only active repositories, verify every point has a unique valid `repo_id`, then switch the ML collection alias atomically. Old collections may be deleted only after ML health and recommendation contract checks pass.

After a database reset: run repository ingestion first, allow the outbox worker to deliver all `repo_index` jobs, verify `pending=0`, `dead=0`, and Qdrant point count equals indexed active repositories, then enable recommendation traffic. Never restore old Qdrant points into a database whose backend `repo_id` values were regenerated.

## Processes and production configuration

Run separately so HTTP scaling never duplicates periodic jobs:

```text
API:                  npm start
Outbox worker:        WORKER_ROLE=outbox npm run worker
Feed reconciliation: WORKER_ROLE=feed npm run worker
Maintenance:         WORKER_ROLE=maintenance npm run worker
```

Use one or more outbox workers; claiming is concurrency-safe. Run one feed and one maintenance worker initially. `WORKER_ROLE=all` is for local development only.

Required production environment variables: `DATABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `JWT_SECRET`, `CLIENT_URL`, `BACKEND_URL`, `REDIS_URL`, `ML_SERVICE_URL`, and `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`. Set all v2 flags in `.env.example` to their shown production values, `FEED_V2_CANARY_PERCENT=100`, and `LEGACY_API_ENABLED=false`. Rotate internal secrets by deploying the new value as primary and the old value as previous, updating ML, then removing the previous value.

Set `TRUST_PROXY=true` only when exactly one trusted ingress proxy is in front of the service. Authentication endpoints have a Redis-backed per-IP/path limit of 20 requests per minute; configure broader request and connection limits at the ingress as well.

`GET /healthz` is process liveness. `GET /readyz` checks PostgreSQL, Redis, ML, and feature dependencies. Internal `GET /api/internal/v2/operations/status` adds outbox and metric state. `POST /api/internal/v2/operations/outbox/:outboxId/replay` retries a dead outbox row.

## Database deployment and clean ingestion

1. Back up Supabase and verify restore access.
2. Set the target `DATABASE_URL` and run `npm run migrate`.
3. Run `npm run schema:audit`; do not deploy on any missing table, index, function, role, or prohibited frontend grant.
4. Stop API and workers before a clean reset.
5. Verify the database host and project manually. Run `npm run db:reset:v2` only with both `RESET_V2_DATABASE=I_UNDERSTAND_THIS_DELETES_DATA` and `ALLOW_REMOTE_DATABASE_RESET=1`.
6. The reset clears `app` and `telemetry`, not `auth.users`. Existing users will be recreated in `app` on their next login. Delete Supabase Auth users separately only if account deletion is intended.
7. Start API plus three worker roles. Run repository and trending ingestion.
8. Wait for outbox drain and rebuild Qdrant from the new backend-issued mappings.
9. Require `/readyz` healthy, outbox `dead=0`, integration tests passing, and ML health healthy before frontend release.

Databases with the known parent-journal history are upgraded directly: the migrator executes and records the retroactive `0004_add_likes_given` and `0005_add_is_saved` SQL before `0008`. Do not set `ADOPT_LEGACY_SCHEMA` for that normal upgrade. The one-time `ADOPT_LEGACY_SCHEMA=1` escape hatch is only for an audited legacy schema whose baseline Drizzle history is genuinely absent or incomplete; exercise it on a clone and run `schema:audit` before using it against the target.

For verification use `npm run build`, `npm test`, database integration with `RUN_DATABASE_INTEGRATION=1`, parent-history migration integration with `RUN_MIGRATION_UPGRADE_INTEGRATION=1`, and HTTP integration with `RUN_HTTP_INTEGRATION=1`. The integration suite uses Redis database 14 by default and clears only that test database.
